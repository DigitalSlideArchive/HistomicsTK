def SparseColorDeconvolution (I, Winit, Beta):
    '''
    Uses sparse non-negative matrix factorization to adaptively deconvolve the 
    color RGB image "I" into intensity images representing distinct stains. 
    Similar approach to ColorDeconvolution but operates adaptively. The input 
    image "I" consisting of RGB values is first transformed into optical density 
    space as a row-matrix, and then is decomposed as V = WH where "W" is a 
    3xk matrix containing stain vectors in columns and "H" is a k x m*n matrix
    of concentrations for each stain vector. The system is solved to encourage 
    sparsity of the columns of "H" - that is most pixels should not contain 
    significant contributions from more than one stain. Can use a hot-start 
    initialization from a color deconvolution matrix.
    *Inputs:
        I (rgbimage) - an RGB image of type unsigned char.
        Winit (matrix, optional) - a 3xK matrix containing the color vectors in 
                    columns. Should not be complemented with ComplementStainMatrix 
                    for sparse decomposition to work correctly.
        Beta (scalar) - regularization factor for sparsity of "H" - recommended 0.5
    *Outputs (tuple):
        Stains (rgbimage) - an rgb image with deconvolved stain intensities in 
                            each channel, values ranging from [0, 255], suitable for display.
        StainsFloat (matrix) - an intensity image of deconvolved stains that is 
                            unbounded, suitable for reconstructing color images 
                            of deconvolved stains with ColorConvolution. Corresponds
                            to the K x N coefficient matrix of deconvolved.
        W (matrix) - the final 3 x K stain matrix produced by the NMF decomposition.
