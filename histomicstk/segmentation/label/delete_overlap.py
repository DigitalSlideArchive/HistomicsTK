def delete_overlap(im_label, overlap_info):
    """
    Deletes overlapping regions from an image label based on overlap information and tile size.

    Args:
        im_label (ndarray): Image label represented as a NumPy array.
        overlap_info (dict): Dictionary containing overlap information.
                            It should have the following keys:
                            'left', 'right', 'top', and 'bottom',
                            each specifying the overlap amount in pixels.

    Returns:
        ndarray: Image label with overlapping regions deleted.
    Note:
        This function assumes the necessary imports, such as `np`, are already present.
