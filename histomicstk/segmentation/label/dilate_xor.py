    Parameters
    ----------
    im_label : array_like
        A labeled mask image wherein intensity of a pixel is the ID of the
        object it belongs to. Non-zero values are considered to be foreground
        objects.

    neigh_width : float, optional
        The width of the ring-like neighborhood around each object.

    Returns
    -------
    im_neigh_label : array_like
        A labeled mask image highlighting pixels in a ring-like neighborhood of
        width upto `neigh_width` around each object in the given label mask.
        The intensity of each pixel in the ring-like neighborhood is set
        equal to the label of the closest object in the given label mask.
        other pixels (including the ones inside objects) are set to zero.
