def rag_color(adj_mat):
    """Generates a coloring of an adjacency graph using the sequential coloring
    algorithm. Used to bin regions from a label image into a small number of
    independent groups that can be processed separately with algorithms like
    multi-label graph cuts or individual active contours. The rationale is to
    color adjacent objects with distinct colors so that their contours can be
    co-evolved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adj_mat : array_like
        A binary matrix of size N x N, where N is the number of objects in
        Label. A value of 'True' at adj_mat(i,j) indicates that objects 'i'
        and 'j' are neighbors. Does not contain entries for background objects.

    Returns
    -------
    Colors : array_like
        A list of colors for the objects encoded in 'adj_mat'. No two objects
        that are connected in 'adj_mat' will share the same color.
