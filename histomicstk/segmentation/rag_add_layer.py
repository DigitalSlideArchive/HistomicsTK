    """Adds an additional layer of dependence to a region adjacency graph,
    connecting each node to the neighbors of its immediate neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adj_mat : array_like
        A binary matrix of size N x N, where N is the number of objects in
        Label. A value of 'True' at adj_mat(i,j) indicates that objects 'i'
        and 'j' are neighbors.

    Returns
    -------
    Layered : array_like
        A version of 'adj_mat' with additional edges to connect 2-neighbors.
